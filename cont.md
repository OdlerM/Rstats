## Continuous distributions
Here you can run a simulation study to see the results of the CLT in practice. Choose the type of distrbution and the size of each sample; 
the app then generates 5000 samples of given size and plots a **histogram** of the means of each sample. You can then choose to plot the 
*probability distribution function* of the normal distribution the mean should tend to, either an empirical PDF with parameters estimated from the samples, 
or a theoretical PDF given by the central limit theorem. 

Observe how the histogram of observed means does not appear to look very normal for small sample sizes (*n* < 10), but gets better with growing
sample size. Around *n* = 30 and more, the effect of CLT is very noticeable.
